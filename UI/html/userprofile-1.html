    As the train pulled away from the Zagreb station on its way to Paris,
    Gonxha must have thought about the consequences of her decision. Not
    only was she leaving family and friends, she was also leaving the only home
    she had ever known. If the Loreto Sisters accepted her application it would
    mean lifetime separation from her family and her country. She could probably
    never even visit her homeland again. The chances of her family visiting
    her were equally remote; travel was expensive and there would be little
    opportunity for her mother, brother, or sister to come to India. Whether
    she felt sad and lonely as the train rolled on toward Paris, Gonxha knew
    that she had made the right choice. Her life belonged to God.
